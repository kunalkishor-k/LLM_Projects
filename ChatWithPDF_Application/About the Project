Title: Interacting with PDF Documents Using Google Generative AI and Streamlit
Introduction
In today's data-driven world, extracting and querying information from PDF documents can be a daunting task, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. This article demonstrates a robust solution that leverages the power of Google Generative AI, FAISS, and Streamlit to create an interactive application for querying PDF documents. This solution is built to handle PDF uploads, extract and chunk text, and use advanced AI models to answer user queries based on the document content.
Problem Statement
The primary challenge addressed by this solution is the efficient extraction and querying of information from PDF documents. The goal is to create an interactive interface where users can upload PDFs and ask questions about the content, receiving accurate and contextually relevant answers.
Architecture
The architecture of this solution is built around several key components:
Streamlit: Provides the interactive web interface for users to upload PDFs and input queries.
Google Generative AI (Gemini): Powers the text generation and embedding models used for querying the document content.
FAISS: Handles the storage and retrieval of document text embeddings, enabling efficient similarity searches.
PyPDF2: Used for extracting text from PDF documents.
LangChain: Orchestrates the interaction between the generative AI model and the user queries.
Flow
PDF Upload: Users upload PDF documents via the Streamlit interface.
Text Extraction: Extract text from the uploaded PDFs using PyPDF2.
Text Chunking: Split the extracted text into manageable chunks using LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
Vector Store Creation: Create and store text embeddings using FAISS.
User Query Input: Users input their queries through the Streamlit interface.
Similarity Search: Perform a similarity search on the vector store to find relevant text chunks.
Query Response Generation: Use Google Generative AI to generate detailed responses based on the relevant text chunks
